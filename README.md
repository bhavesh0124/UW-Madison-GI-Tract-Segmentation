# UW-Madison-GI-Tract-Segmentation

In this competition, youâ€™ll create a model to automatically segment the stomach and intestines on MRI scans. The MRI scans are from actual cancer patients who had 1-5 MRI scans on separate days during their radiation treatment. You'll base your algorithm on a dataset of these scans to come up with creative deep learning solutions that will help cancer patients get better care.
